# Committing changes and adding scanning video (2025-10-11 20:39Z)

_**User (2025-10-11 20:40Z)**_

ok, commit any changes to github first before we begin

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll check for any changes in your repository and commit them to GitHub. I can see the git diff. Now let me commit the current changes: Perfect! ✅ **All Changes Successfully Committed and Pushed**

## **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Gauge Label Doubling Issue**
- **Removed**: `::after` pseudo-elements that were creating duplicate indicator lights
- **Result**: Clean, single-line labels without duplication

### **2. Added Scanning Video**
Added `scanning-for-replicant.mp4` to the right panel:
- **Video Display**: 300px wide with professional styling
- **Placement**: Above the terminal in the right column
- **Border**: 2px solid cyan with 8px rounded corners
- **Auto-play**: Loops continuously during test
- **Initialization**: Starts playing when page loads and when VK interface reveals

### **Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│  Eye & Heart Videos │   SCANNING VIDEO         │
│  Gauge & Controls   │  ▶ Replicant Detection   │
│  Questions/Answers  │   TERMINAL OUTPUT        │
└─────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

**Commit**: `187e60f` - Successfully pushed to GitHub! 🚀

The gauge labels are now clean and readable, and the scanning video fills the unused right area perfectly! 👁️🎬
